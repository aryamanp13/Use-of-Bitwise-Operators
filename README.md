# Use-of-Bitwise-Operators

## Aim:
To study how to use bitwise operators is cpp

## Theory:
Bitwise operators change/manipulate the given input or data at individual bits level. They operate on integer operands treating them as sequence of binary digits.

1. Bitwise AND(&): Performs logical AND on corresponding bits of 2 inputs.
2. Bitwise OR(|): Performs logical OR on corresponding bits of 2 inputs.
3. Bitwise XOR(^): Performs logical XOR on corresponding bits of 2 inputs.
4. Bitwise NOT(~): Performs logical NOT on corresponding input.
5. Left shift(<<): Shifts the desired bit to 2 spaces left.
6. Right shift(>>): Shifts the desired bit to 2 spaces right.
